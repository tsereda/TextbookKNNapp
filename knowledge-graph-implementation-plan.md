# Knowledge Graph System Implementation Plan

## 1. Set up the development environment
- [x] Install Python (if not already installed)
- [x] Install Neo4j
- [x] Install Vue.js and Vue CLI
- [x] Set up a virtual environment for Python
- [x] Install required Python packages:
  - Flask
  - neo4j-driver
  - PyPDF2 (or a similar PDF processing library)
  - numpy (for vector operations)
- [ ] Install required Node.js packages for Vue.js:
  - axios (for API calls)
  - cytoscape (for graph visualization)

## 2. Create the Neo4j database schema
- [ ] Define node labels: Section, KeyTerm, Concept, Media, Page
- [ ] Define relationship types: RELATED_TO, APPEARS_ON, etc.
- [ ] Set up indexes for optimized query performance

## 3. Develop the Flask API and integrate PDF processing
- [ ] Create a new Python file: `app.py`
- [ ] Set up Flask application
- [ ] Implement Neo4j driver connection
- [ ] Implement PDF parsing functionality:
  - [ ] Extract sections, key terms, concepts, and media from the PDF
  - [ ] Implement knowledge graph creation logic
  - [ ] Add page number association with nodes
- [ ] Create API endpoints:
  - [ ] `/upload_pdf`: Handle PDF upload and processing
  - [ ] `/get_pdf_list`
  - [ ] `/get_pdf`
  - [ ] `/get_knowledge_graph`
  - [ ] `/get_chapters_and_problems`
  - [ ] `/get_chapter_questions`
  - [ ] `/get_similarity_scores`
  - [ ] `/get_relevant_nodes`
  - [ ] `/get_relevant_pages`
- [ ] Implement Cypher queries for each endpoint
- [ ] Set up PDF storage and retrieval system

## 4. Build the Vue.js frontend
- [ ] Create a new Vue.js project
- [ ] Set up project structure
- [ ] Create components:
  - [ ] PDF uploader
  - [ ] PDF viewer
  - [ ] Knowledge graph visualization (using Cytoscape)
  - [ ] Chapter and problem listing
  - [ ] Question display
  - [ ] Similarity scores display
  - [ ] Relevant nodes display
  - [ ] Relevant pages display
- [ ] Implement API calls to the Flask backend
- [ ] Design and implement the user interface

## 5. Integrate all components
- [ ] Ensure proper communication between frontend and API
- [ ] Test data flow between all parts of the system

## 6. Testing
- [ ] Develop unit tests for Python components
- [ ] Develop unit tests for Vue.js components
- [ ] Perform integration testing
- [ ] Test Cypher query performance
- [ ] Test PDF processing and knowledge graph creation

## 7. Optimization and refinement
- [ ] Profile and optimize knowledge graph creation process
- [ ] Optimize Cypher queries
- [ ] Refine user interface based on testing feedback

## 8. Documentation
- [ ] Write API documentation
- [ ] Create user guide for the frontend
- [ ] Document the knowledge graph schema and relationships
- [ ] Document the PDF processing and knowledge graph creation process
